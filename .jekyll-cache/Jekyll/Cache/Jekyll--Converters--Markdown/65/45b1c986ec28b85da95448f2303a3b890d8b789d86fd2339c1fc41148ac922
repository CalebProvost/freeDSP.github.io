I"Å<p>The freeDSPx AMP x2 is a stereo class D amplifier module with an I¬≤S input serial audio port. While it is primarily designed for the freeDSP, it can basically be used with any I¬≤S source (such as Raspberry Pi etc). It comes as a bare circuit board without housing and can be incorporated into your own projects. The module is based on Texas Instruments‚Äô <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tas5760m.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TAS5760M</a> amplifier chip which converts the digital input signal directly to an amplified analog audio signal, and thus saves one step of conversion and possible source of quality loss.</p>
