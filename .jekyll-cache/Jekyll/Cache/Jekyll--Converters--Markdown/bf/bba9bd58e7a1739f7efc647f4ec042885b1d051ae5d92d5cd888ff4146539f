I"š<h1>freeDSP</h1>
<h2>A DIY audio dsp project.</h2>
<p>The freeDSP is an open-source digital signal processor family for the do-it-yourself community. The projects feature DSP main boards, programmers, and addon boards. The freeDSP project enables end-users to create state of the art digital audio processors for a variety of uses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Room compensation / system equalization</li>
<li>Digital crossovers in active loudspeaker concepts&nbsp;</li>
<li>Multiband dynamics processing</li>
<li>Delay compensation / phase shift</li>
<li>Bass enhancement</li>
<li>Subwoofer integration</li>
<li>Advanced instrument audio effect units</li>
<li>Stereo image widening</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h2>It&rsquo;s Open Source</h2>
<p>All freeDSP boards are published under a creative commons license (CC-BY-SA). It allows the unrestricted use and modification of the module. We would be happy if you join the team and improve or extend the freeDSP family. We really like the open hardware idea. :-)</p>
<h2>Easy programmability with SigmaStudio.</h2>
<p>No advanced coding skills are necessary. The freeDSP works with a graphical development environment. The programming model is function-block based. Just drag-and-drop some processing blocks and virtual cables - and you are ready to go! The Windows based software can be downloaded from Analog Devices free of charge. For more information please refer to the <a href="http://www.analog.com/en/design-center/processors-and-dsp/evaluation-and-development-software/ss_sigst_02.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analog Devices website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1: Order board and parts...</span></p>
<p>Select your freeDSP main board from the overview table below. Additionally, you will need a programmer. We recommend building the freeUSBi programmer for real time tuning of your programms. Download the Gerber files and manufacture the board. You have to order all necessary parts yourself. We do not offer centralized buying at the moment!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2: Solder / Assemble...</span></p>
<p>You can find the part list and the assembly print for soldering in the table below (e.g., in the corresponding getting started guides). Some soldering experience is required for SMD components. Hopefully, there will be preassamled freeDSP kits again in the future. :-)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3: Do the programming...</span></p>
<p>The graphical development environment SigmaStudio can be used for easy programming. It can be downloaded for free (account needed) at the SigmaStudio website. Please have a look at the getting started guides to get your freeDSP up and running with SigmaStudio. For further questions please refer to the SigmaStudio documentation and forum.... enjoy!</p>
