I"V<p>The freeDSPx AMP x4 is a four channel amplifier module with a digital eight channel TDM input, designed to be used with a freeDSP module. The freeDSPx AMP x4 is a medium power class-D amplifier based on the TAS5720M IC from Texas Instruments and can supply up to 25 Watts with less than 1% THD+N to a 4â„¦ load per channel. The amplifier directly uses a digital input signal and circumvents an additional digital to analog conversion after the DSP. Overall noise and signal to noise ratio will be improved through that. Two freeDSPx AMP x4 can be stacked to form an eight channel amplifier.</p>
