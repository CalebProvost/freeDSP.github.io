I"õ<p>The freeUSBi is a low-budget real-time programming device for the freeDSP and other DSP boards from Analog Devices. It is based on a CY7C68013A MINI BOARD combined with an adapter PCB (printed circuit board) that adds the possibility of realtime programming. It has the same features as the Analog Devices USB interface (EVAL-ADUSB2EBZ), such as changing parameters while already using the freeDSP or easy changes of the schematic in SigmaStudio. You also can write your program to the EEPROM.</p>
